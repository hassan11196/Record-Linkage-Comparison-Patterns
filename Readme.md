The underlying records stem from the epidemiological cancer registry of the
German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Epidemiologisches Krebsregister NRW,
http://www.krebsregister.nrw.de). Creation of comparison patterns and
assignment of matching status were undertaken by staff members of
the Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI)
at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz,
Germany (http://www.imbei.uni-mainz.de).
